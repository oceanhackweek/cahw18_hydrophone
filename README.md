[Interactive Demo Notebook](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/cahw2018_hydrophone/blob/master/notebooks/OOI_Hydrophone_BB.ipynb)

Interactive demo of streaming spectrograms and sound with ipywidgets.

### Data Access

- many files of different size
- about 2GB for 2hours around eclipse
- require concatenating and merging into one mseed stream

[Merging Notebook](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/cahw2018_hydrophone/blob/master/notebooks/OOI_mseed_merge.ipynb)

### Data processing 
- we need to efficiently calculate spectrograms of many files
- so far we calculate spectrograms sequentially and store them line by line into a csv file
- need to allow to parallelize
- need to preserve time stamps of spectrograms
- need to store into an xarray/netcdf/hdf5 -like format with time stamps and chunk


### Clustering 
- chunks of 5 secs
- dimensionality reduction with TSNE
